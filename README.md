# Sentiment Analysis for Customer Reviews  

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project applies NLP to analyze customer feedback and extract actionable business insights.  
It uses *ML, Deep Learning, and Transformers (BERT)* for sentiment classification.  

## ðŸš€ Key Features  
- Text preprocessing: tokenization, lemmatization, stopword removal  
- Models: Naive Bayes + TF-IDF, LSTM, DistilBERT fine-tuning  
- Word clouds & frequency plots of positive vs negative sentiment  
- Streamlit dashboard to explore sentiment by category, product, and region  
- SHAP explainability for NLP models  

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset  
- [Amazon Reviews dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/bittlingmayer/amazonreviews)  

## âš™ Tech Stack  
- Python (NLTK, spaCy, scikit-learn)  
- TensorFlow/Keras (LSTM)  
- HuggingFace Transformers (DistilBERT)  
- Streamlit / Plotly for dashboard  

## ðŸ“Š Results  
- DistilBERT achieved highest accuracy (91%)  
- Top negative sentiment drivers: delivery delays, poor packaging  
- Positive sentiment driven by product quality & affordability  

## ðŸ’¡ Business Impact  
Helped uncover *3 key areas of improvement* in customer experience â†’ logistics, packaging, customer support.
